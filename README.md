## The-earth

It is a **[project](https://bumboobee.github.io/the-earth/)** not to see but to feel. The vibe of this page is **beyond or judgment**. 

**Imagine a earth without humans:** 
- how this place that we call now home would be? 
- do we deserve to live here?
- the earth would be better without humans? 

These are some questions that make we **reflect** if what we are doing with the planet **is right**. 
**Global warming is above the levels, forest clearing is getting worse every day**. The point is, our actions **matter the most for the earth**. 

> So let me ask you, what do you do to make the difference before leave this life? 

Well is this mean time. Checkout the project. Perhaps some brainstorm cames to you and reveal what can you make to help save the planet!
